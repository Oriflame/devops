# How to contribute

First of all it's recommended to discuss with existing project contributors like in the [issues](https://github.com/Oriflame/devops/issues) section.

**Oriflame contributors**

* Ask to be joined to the project contributors (ask Platform team)
* Create a new branch from **develop** under feature folder, e.g. **feature/cool-feature-name**
* Create a pull request to **develop** branch and ask for review

**Outside contributor**:

* Fork the repository
* Create a new branch from **develop** under feature folder, e.g. **feature/cool-feature-name**
* Create a pull request to **develop** branch and ask for review
