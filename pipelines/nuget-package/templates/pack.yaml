# about this template: it contains steps needed for restoring and building the solution

# guidance for parameters:
# - all of parameters should be passed from calling pipeline
# - all parameters are replaced in the template when the template is loaded = it's a simple replace
# - therefore all usages needs to be surrounded by ''

parameters:
  pathToProjects: '! need to be set by pipeline !'
